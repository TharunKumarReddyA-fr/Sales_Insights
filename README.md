# Sales Insights

## Project Summary

Sales Insights is a Power BI project developed to address the challenges of inconsistent and unreliable sales data faced by Atlec Hardwareâ€™s sales leadership. Through comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and intuitive visualizations, the dashboard delivers accurate, real-time insights across multiple regions, empowering informed decision-making and strategic performance management.

## Problem Statement

Atlec Hardware has recently experienced a decline in sales, largely due to limited visibility into regional performance metrics. The Sales Director currently relies on verbal updates and fragmented Excel reports from regional managers, which are often inconsistent and difficult to interpret. This lack of reliable, timely data hampers effective decision-making. To overcome these challenges, a centralized, interactive dashboard is needed to deliver real-time, clear insights into sales performance across all regions.

## Project Objectives

Guided by the Ames Grid framework, this project focused on four key components: purpose, stakeholders, end results, and success criteria.

- **Purpose:** To enhance sales visibility and reduce reliance on manual data handling processes that were time-consuming and prone to errors.
- **Stakeholders:** The primary stakeholders include the Sales Director and regional managers, who require accurate, consistent data to make informed decisions.
- **End Result:** Develop a centralized, interactive dashboard that consolidates sales data from all regions, providing real-time insights.
- **Success Criteria:** Improved data consistency and accuracy, streamlined reporting processes, and empowered leadership with actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI:** Used for data visualization, dashboard creation, and interactive reporting.
- **SQL:** Employed for querying and extracting relevant sales data from databases to ensure accurate and structured data inputs for the dashboard.

## Key Features & Functionality

- **Centralized Sales Dashboard:** Visualizes sales data across regions, providing up-to-date insights into sales trends and performance.
